### Script Description:

The Python script provided is a basic example of how to use the Google Maps Geocoding API to retrieve the latitude and longitude coordinates of a given address. Here's a breakdown of its capabilities:

1. **Installation**:

   - The script requires the `requests` library, which is used for making HTTP requests. You can install it using `pip`:

     ```
     pip install requests
     ```

2. **Usage**:

   - Replace `'YOUR_API_KEY'` with your actual Google API key obtained from the Google Developer Console. Ensure that you have the necessary billing and API access enabled for the specific Google service you intend to use (in this case, the Geocoding API).

   - Set the `address` variable to the address you want to geocode.

   - Run the script using a Python interpreter. It will send a request to the Google Geocoding API and print the latitude and longitude of the provided address.

3. **Capabilities**:

   - Sends a GET request to the Google Maps Geocoding API with the provided address and API key.

   - Handles HTTP response codes, checking for success (status code 200) and displaying an error message if the request fails.

   - Parses the JSON response from the API to extract the latitude and longitude coordinates.

   - Prints the latitude and longitude to the console if the API returns results, or displays an error message if there are no results or an error occurs.

### Important Details:

- **API Key**: You must replace `'YOUR_API_KEY'` with your actual Google API key. Without a valid API key, the script will not work.

- **API Usage and Billing**: Be aware of Google's usage policies and pricing for their APIs. Some services may have free usage tiers, while others may incur charges beyond certain usage limits. Always check the Google API documentation and billing information for the specific service you intend to use.

- **Error Handling**: The script includes basic error handling to check for HTTP request failures and API errors. You can enhance error handling based on your specific use case.

- **API Limits**: Google APIs often have rate limits and usage quotas. Be sure to review the documentation to understand these limits and adjust your usage accordingly.

- **Security**: Keep your API key secure and do not share it publicly in your code. Use environment variables or other secure methods to store and retrieve your API key.

- **API Documentation**: Refer to the official Google API documentation for the Geocoding API or any other Google service you wish to use. The documentation provides detailed information on API endpoints, parameters, and usage guidelines.

- **Dependency**: The script uses the `requests` library, which is a commonly used library for making HTTP requests in Python. Ensure that you have it installed in your Python environment.

By following these guidelines and understanding the provided script, you can interact with Google APIs in a Python application to retrieve data from various Google services.
